The Berlin-based artist follows a reductivist approach to painting by restricting the creative gestures on canvas. Her paintings directly engage the viewer with the concept of deconstruction by demonstrating deftly uncoordinated compositions that “deliberately reveal traces of use, whereby the nature of their materiality is brought to the foreground”, as the painter highlights herself.</p><p>Minimal mark-making, apparent brushworks and spray-painted compositions make her artworks characterized by spontaneity in appearance, while maintaining their mindfully balanced components in an alluring visual expression. The artist aims to derive benefits from the materials she uses, such as linen and cotton. She exploits their textural qualities on canvas in order to reveal deeper and more emotional reactions from the viewers. Brosinski adopts an approach to painting that envelops together both intellectual and distinctively personal rules. At first glance, her paintings introduce new forms of communication between irregular lines, childish squiggles, colors looking like stains, abstract marks, or even famous cartoons. On top of that, this uncomfortable visual allegory suggests a sharp-witted, effective and energetic juxtaposition on canvas elaborating the artist&#39;s emphasis on materiality, raw arrangements, and simplistic shapes. In this respect, Brosinski creates a painting and then deconstructs and reconfigures it, eventually developing new possibilities based on the first creative arrangement.</p>', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=45&quality=80&resize_to=fill&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2Fxl-py25KptcalVaF2lqsIQ%2Flarge.jpg&width=45')

Though defined by simplicity, many works reveal a great freedom, deliberately switching between abstract and figurative, between monochrome and colourful. Often minimalistic in their design featuring geometric shapes, originally deriving from features of his studio interior like door frames, curtains and windows, the works have recently become more complex and symbolically charged through poetic titles. </p><p>His small format compositions of only few lines, basic grids and simple shapes remind us of the paintings of Raoul de Keyser or the abstract works of Richard Diebenkorn, though they greatly differ in the treatment of the surface. Fox likes to divide the image and not to treat the image area as a whole. He intersects his compositions by inserting horizontal, vertical and even diagonal lines and inserts painted or drawn frames surrounding a main part of his works. The spectator journeys through his oeuvre as if through a labyrinth, digging into depth to uncover what cannot be fully grasped at first sight. </p><p>Fox is a painter who appreciates traditional materials like oil on canvas or paper as well as watercolour, but for inspiration he also experiments with other media like drawing, photography and printing. Whichever medium he decides for, colour plays a central role and is often a starting point for the pictorial content. Fox thereby reverts to secondary and tertiary colors, frequently coloured grey tones: antique pink, grey-green, a blue or purple black. In addition, the works show a strong spatial quality, as Fox plays with different layers, overpaints elements or scratches on the surface to reveal the layer beneath. </p>', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=45&quality=80&resize_to=fill&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F8brKmWjkgTfC54VYxuCcTQ%2Flarge.jpg&width=45')

He then began working on large scale works using bottle dispensers filled with colorful synthetic materials instead of traditional paints and brushes.

The bustling streets of Cornhill and Threadneedle, filled with London&#39;s iconic double-decker buses, converge towards the pinnacle of the renowned building, receding into the bright background. Israëls was known for riding double-decker buses, which allowed him to enjoy the city from an elevated vantage point. The unique point-of-view of The Royal Stock Exchange invites viewers to experience a transient moment as a tourist in the center of the city, above the bustling crowds.</p><p>Born in Amsterdam in 1865, Isaac Israëls was a prodigious artist who demonstrated innate talent from a young age, much like his esteemed father, Jozef Israëls, a prominent member of the influential Hague School. Often called the &quot;Amsterdam Impressionist,&quot; his association with the renowned Tachtigers, a group of Dutch artists and intellectuals, had a profound impact on his artistic vision. Sharing the belief that form must harmonize with content, the Tachtigers nurtured Israëls&#39; development of a highly evocative and emotive style that perfectly complemented his emotionally charged subjects. While Israëls was identified as an Impressionist during his time, his distinctive technique, reminiscent of the master Paul Cézanne, was characterized by bold painterly brushstrokes, rich color palettes and a meticulous spatial arrangement, setting him apart as a masterful artist of his era.</p><p>Early in his career, Israëls exhibited a keen eye for capturing the vibrancy of Amsterdam&#39;s streets and cabarets, skillfully portraying the energy and atmosphere of urban life with remarkable artistry. Drawn by the allure of Paris, he eventually made Montmartre his home, immersing himself in the vibrant artistic community alongside luminaries such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas. In this dynamic environment, Israëls&#39; mastery of his style emerged, fueled by his deep appreciation for modern city life.</p><p>In 1911, Israëls experienced his father&#39;s death, which led him to seek solace abroad. Reluctant to return to his homeland, he moved to London in 1913. Inspired by the bustling streets of West End, the lively pedestrians along the Thames and the iconic landmarks of Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street, as well as ballet students, Israëls found abundant creative inspiration in his new surroundings. Israëls&#39; paintings of London, including this very work, are highly regarded for their energy and spirit. Considered rare gems in his oeuvre, his delightful creations perfectly capture the essence of London&#39;s dynamic vitality in the years before the onset of the First World War.</p><p>During his lifetime, Israëls regularly exhibited at the Paris Salon and was celebrated for his ability to capture the beauty of everyday life in a way that was both poetic and poignant. His paintings are housed in the collections of prestigious museums worldwide, including the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and the Brooklyn Museum. His oeuvre was prominently showcased in the Kunstmuseum Den Haag’s 2008-2009 exhibition Jozef and Isaac Israëls. </p><p>Circa 1913-1914</p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Oil on canvas''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=800&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2FyaTdheIraqoBQDMiBWjglg%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=487')

This new direction evokes the work of Henri Michaux. Tanc is also a composer and certain notions from the electronic and experimental music inhabit his work, without any doubt; the obsession for rhythm and pulsation tend to produce an intense, fascinating painting with a unique vibrating dimension. He has shows in France regularly, but colorful or grey, his work has gained international prominence with exhibitions in Germany (Skalitzers Contemporary Art), in the UK (The French Art Studio), Morocco (David Bloch Gallery) or New York (Catherine Ahnell Gallery). He is one of the most promising artists of his generation.</p><p>About the artwork: </p><p>While the manuscript nowadays tends to disappear, Tanc explores the aesthetic dimension of writing. Inspired by his high school years, when he took notes and produced pages as illegible as they seemed nice, he develops a system of automatic writing, executed entirely with spray paint, halfway between calligraphy and graffiti. The viewer may find meaning or even words, but the aim is not to read but feel the rhythm of writing. Large size and often monochrome works let perceive new forms, a new alphabet. We do not know if the writing goes from left to right or vice versa. Mid-abstract, semi-figurative, each piece is designed as a landscape, with an accumulation of lines that end up creating a horizon. Aided by glow and matte effects that gloss paint gives in some places on the canvas, this new series is about rhythm and frequencies, revealing a music in which the eye can get lost and escape.</p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Acrylic paint and spray on Canvas''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=800&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F5cyShJ9mpvQXBEatV-EVGQ%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=450')

The dynasty reigned for nearly 300 years between the 7th and 10th centuries CE, and oversaw a cultural and artistic “golden age” in Chinese civilization. Remnants of paints and other pigments remain visible along the horses’ flanks and legs, indicating the sculptures were once sumptuously colored and glazed. The stoic equines each take a bold striding stance, forming a perfect pair.</p><p>Horses held a special significance in Tang China, in part due to a particular affection of the second Tang ruler, Emperor Taizong. He was deeply devoted to his beloved horse “Autumn Dew,” who he credited with saving his life during a pivotal battle to unify China under the emperor’s reign. Horses’ continued importance in Tang expansion and military might made the animal a strong symbol of imperial power and wealth. </p><p>Tang Dynasty funerary sculpture, known as mingqi, reflect a harmonious blend of Han Chinese traditions and external cultural influences arriving to China through the Silk Road. More than a facilitator of global commercial transactions, the Silk Road served as a network for cultural exchange between East Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and beyond. Along its routes, travelers and merchants from disparate cultures encountered one another, fostering the exchange of ideas, philosophies, art forms and scientific knowledge. Mingqi such as these, which highlight animals that facilitated travel and trade, were intended to accompany and serve the deceased in the afterlife, and frequently depict guardian figures and the pack animals that were essential in the ever-expanding world.</p><p>Circa 7th-10th century CE</p><p>22 1/2“ high x 21 1/4” wide x 6“ deep each</p>', '''Includes assemblage; bas-relief; carvings; figurines; masks; mosaics; statues; wall pieces.

The environmental devastation was significant enough to spark a movement and several pieces of environmental regulation. In the Santa Barbara spill, the damage from oil was painfully visible in the dead seabirds, dolphins, and other wildlife. What was not directly visible and what scientists were only beginning to determine was the effects of burning oil, gas, and coal on global temperatures. There is a delicate balance that maintains the ecosystems of Earth’s most beautiful spaces and habitats of all its creatures.

On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p><p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p><p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group.

In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p><p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p><p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p><p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p><p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Industrial paint, spray paint, and oil pastel on paper''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=800&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2FGZe71eKOyriQF78V2-FjVQ%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=606')

She began painting as an outlet of grief; creating something beautiful as the result of loss. Through her creative practice, she has found healing and further offers to her community safe spaces for troubled teens and women to heal through the meditative process of painting. Her artworks are a language, a push forward in new directions and achievements, while always inspired by history. Berta mixes minimalism with underlying texture and embraces modernism while compiling the odds and ends of her attempts to let her art speak for itself.</p><p>Her abstract works often include reminders of her travels expressed in unexpected sequences of patterns as well as distortion of perspectives and subconscious spaces. Manipulating the texture with several layers of texture paste and acrylic paint, she will work and re-work her canvases, layering textures to give added dimension, and creating works that intrigue and invite the viewer to explore not only the surface but also the inner language of the painting.</p><p>A passionate, award-winning artist of Hungarian heritage, Clara Berta&#39;s dynamic and highly textural abstract works have been exhibited and collected worldwide.</p><p>SELECT EXHIBITIONS<br>2020 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2019 Bistango Restaurant with Ethos Contemporary, Irvine, CA<br>2019 MAC Fine Art, Ft.

She originally started painting with pigments, powders, and waxes and went on to experiment with different mediums and processes to keep evolving her artworks. As love and joy are paramount emotions in life, Goldhammer hopes her series incorporating the “I Love You” message expands to reach a wide audience. Connecting people through public art is one way she believes her street murals can impact lives, as it is impossible to view her work and not feel a sense of joy and love.</p><p>Painting a convergence of color and emotion, she builds and layers bold colors organically, allowing the process to determine the outcome. There is no analyzing, conceptualizing, or judging that takes place. It all happens in the moment, as a union between her, the canvas, and the paint. Amber Goldhammer frequently draws inspiration for her palette from the colors of the ocean, saying, “I get to take in the essence of the ocean every day, which fuels my creativity and brings me peace.”</p><p>A worldwide collected young artist with ongoing concurrent exhibitions in galleries throughout the United States and Switzerland, Goldhammer&#39;s artworks have also been exhibited at major international art fairs. Her original paintings have been showcased in print and online publications, and on such TV series as “Million Dollar Listing,” “Being Mary Jane,” “The Catch” as well as both multi-Emmy® nominated series, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”, and “Scandal.” Goldhammer’s art is also featured on Netflix’s original series, “G.L.O.W.” by “Weeds” creator, Jenji Kohan.</p><p>Artspace Warehouse has been representing and exhibiting Amber Goldhammer&#39;s original artworks since 2011.

Tanc&#39;s practice reached a turning point: ever since his New York show at Catherine Ahnell Gallery, the artist left aside the colorful explosion that used to mark his paintings and is now more interested in nuances of black, lineary variations and automatic writing. This new direction evokes the work of Henri Michaux. Tanc is also a composer and certain notions from the electronic and experimental music inhabit his work, without any doubt; the obsession for rhythm and pulsation tend to produce an intense, fascinating painting with a unique vibrating dimension. He has shows in France regularly, but colorful or grey, his work has gained international prominence with exhibitions in Germany (Skalitzers Contemporary Art), in the UK (The French Art Studio), Morocco (David Bloch Gallery) or New York (Catherine Ahnell Gallery). He is one of the most promising artists of his generation.</p><p>About the artwork: </p><p>While the manuscript nowadays tends to disappear, Tanc explores the aesthetic dimension of writing. Inspired by his high school years, when he took notes and produced pages as illegible as they seemed nice, he develops a system of automatic writing, executed entirely with spray paint, halfway between calligraphy and graffiti. The viewer may find meaning or even words, but the aim is not to read but feel the rhythm of writing. Large size and often monochrome works let perceive new forms, a new alphabet. We do not know if the writing goes from left to right or vice versa. Mid-abstract, semi-figurative, each piece is designed as a landscape, with an accumulation of lines that end up creating a horizon. Aided by glow and matte effects that gloss paint gives in some places on the canvas, this new series is about rhythm and frequencies, revealing a music in which the eye can get lost and escape.</p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Acrylic on canvas''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=800&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2FWjDj_Eev689rQ3dT14N8kQ%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=568')

(see attached installation photographs) It is from the Estate of Alma LeBrecht and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts. (LeBrecht was a longtime drawing instructor at the MFA). The verso of the work bears the original documentation card from the museum noting this is Study No. 1 for a proposed lithograph, and indicates the proposed measurements. &quot;African Royalty&quot; was created during the same period as Bearden’s celebrated work “Watching the Good Train Go By” – a photomontage – i.e. a collage that includes photographs. According to the National Gallery of Art, “In Watching the Good Train Go By, Bearden used photographs to create cut out pictures of trains, faces, and arms, combined with patterned papers, creating a busy scene. Bearden’s art was influenced by his love for jazz and the blues. Music was often the subject of his work, and it also influenced his way of working. One distinguishing feature of jazz is improvisation...Bearden advised a younger artist to “become a blues singer—only you sing on the canvas. You improvise—you find the rhythm and catch it good, and structure as you go along—then the song is you…”<br>According to press materials from Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, which in 2011 hosted a critically acclaimed exhibition of other Bearden collages, the artist believed that “art is made from other art: ..” This idea is literally present in the act of collage-making—taking images, colors, and forms out of one context, altering them, and juxtaposing them with other pre-existing images, colors, and forms to create something new. But it is equally apparent in Bearden’s celebration of jazz and blues, the inspiration he drew from African art, and his passion for telling the stories and representing the cultures of ordinary black Americans...”<br>In a 2011 New York Times review, critic Roberta Smith wrote, “Romare Bearden (1911-88) spent more than 30 years striving to be a great artist, and in the early 1960s, when he took up collage in earnest, he became one. As historical shows go, this one feels unusually of-the-moment. For one thing the improvisational cross-fertilizing of art mediums that Bearden helped pioneer via collage is more and more the norm; for another, paper has probably never been more popular as an art material, for work in both two and three dimensions. .. Bearden took up collage sometime in the late 1950s, after a relatively fallow period during which what little painting he made was mostly abstract. A trip to France and Italy with his wife in 1961, to see many of the museums and churches he had visited 10 years before while studying painting on the G.I. Bill of Rights, may have reconnected him to figuration. In 1963 he helped organize Spiral, a group of African-American artists interested in finding new ways to portray black life in America. Bearden suggested that the group collaborate on collage, an implicitly collaborative medium. This didn’t happen, but evidently he found his métier in the process of demonstrating the possibilities. By then Bearden was in his early 50s, a late bloomer by most standards. But… his collages have a pictorial sophistication, cultural erudition and emotional wisdom that it is hard to imagine in a younger artist. They are full-flavored distillations of the culturally rich, occasionally privileged life Bearden had led up that point: his experience of black life growing up in the South and then in Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance; his immersion in jazz and African sculpture; his study at the Art Students League with George Grosz; his stint as a political cartoonist with a Baltimore newspaper (during which he did extensive research on the history of cartooning); his friendships with artists white and black, including Stuart Davis, Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis and William H. Johnson; his familiarity with the evolution of the New York School painting and its Cubist roots; and his experience, stretching over more than 30 years, of observing urban life up close while supporting himself as a social worker in New York City… But by the late 1960s Bearden was subjecting collage to various mechanical and hands-on manipulations. These included rephotographing (via photostat) and enlarging his own collages for further use, a practice pursued by artists from the outsider Henry Darger (whose work had not yet been rediscovered at the time) to budding appropriationists like Richard Prince and Barbara Kruger, starting in the mid ’70s. “Watching the Good Train Go By,” [later scholarship has documented that work as done in 1964], with its group of colorfully clothed figures, is actually a collage on top of an earlier rephotographed collage. If you look closely, images that appear to be pieced together lack the telltale seams..”</p><p>&quot;African Royalty&quot; is elegantly floated and framed with a die-cut back to reveal the museum card with the artists name and information; it also bears an exhibition label from the Nassau Museum of Art.

This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p><p>Amber Goldhammer is best known for creating vibrant abstract paintings with a street art edge. She originally started painting with pigments, powders, and waxes and went on to experiment with different mediums and processes to keep evolving her artworks. As love and joy are paramount emotions in life, Goldhammer hopes her series incorporating the “I Love You” message expands to reach a wide audience. Connecting people through public art is one way she believes her street murals can impact lives, as it is impossible to view her work and not feel a sense of joy and love.</p><p>Painting a convergence of color and emotion, she builds and layers bold colors organically, allowing the process to determine the outcome. There is no analyzing, conceptualizing, or judging that takes place. It all happens in the moment, as a union between her, the canvas, and the paint. Amber Goldhammer frequently draws inspiration for her palette from the colors of the ocean, saying, “I get to take in the essence of the ocean every day, which fuels my creativity and brings me peace.”</p><p>A worldwide collected young artist with ongoing concurrent exhibitions in galleries throughout the United States and Switzerland, Goldhammer&#39;s artworks have also been exhibited at major international art fairs. Her original paintings have been showcased in print and online publications, and on such TV series as “Million Dollar Listing,” “Being Mary Jane,” “The Catch” as well as both multi-Emmy® nominated series, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”, and “Scandal.” Goldhammer’s art is also featured on Netflix’s original series, “G.L.O.W.” by “Weeds” creator, Jenji Kohan.</p><p>SOLO EXHIBITIONS<br>2021 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA, USA<br>2020 Christopher Martin Gallery, Dallas, TX, USA<br>2012 Meridian’s, Ventura, CA, USA<br>2010 Healing Bodywork, Santa Monica, CA, USA</p><p>GROUP EXHIBITIONS<br>2022 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA, USA<br>2020 Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>2020 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA, USA<br>2020 Kevin Barry Fine Art, Las Vegas, NV<br>2020 Ethos Contemporary, Newport Beach, CA<br>2020 Christopher Martin Gallery, Dallas, TX<br>2019 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2019 Kevin Barry Fine Art, Las Vegas, NV<br>2019 Ethos Contemporary, Newport Beach, CA<br>2018 Artspace Warehouse - Los Angeles, CA<br>2017 Jackson Gallery – Palm Springs, CA<br>2017 Kevin Barry Fine Art – San Francisco, CA<br>2017 Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>2015 Artspace Warehouse - Los Angeles, CA<br>2015 JCC Gallery - Santa Barbara, CA<br>2015 Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>2015 Michael Kate Design - Santa Barbara, CA<br>2014 National Peace Project – USA<br>2014 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2014 Burbank Creative Arts Center, Burbank, CA<br>2013 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2012 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2012 Artlife Gallery, El Segundo, CA<br>2012 Encino Community Center, Encino, CA</p><p>ART FAIRS<br>2021 AAF New York, NY<br>2020 LA Art Show, CA<br>2020 Art Palm Springs, CA<br>2019 AAF New York, NY<br>2019 Art Palm Springs, CA<br>2018 AAF New York, NY<br>2018 AAF Hong Kong<br>2017 AAF New York, NY<br>2016 AAF Hong Kong<br>2016 AAF New York, NY<br>2015 AAF New York, NY<br>2014 Love Art Fair Toronto, Canada<br>2013 Affordable Art Fair New York, NY<br>2013 Affordable Art Fair Seattle, WA</p><p>REPRESENTATIONS<br>Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, USA</p><p>PRESS<br>2015 Scene Magazine - Santa Barbara, Ca<br>2014 Avant Garde Magazine – Nationwide (USA)<br>2013 Blick Winter Catalog<br>2013 Fusionart, Rassouli<br>2011 Origin Magazine – Nationwide (USA)</p><p>TV &amp; FILM<br>Insecure, HBO<br>GLOW, Netflix<br>L.A.’s Finest, Netflix<br>Planet of the Apps, Apple TV<br>The Catch, ABC<br>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, CW<br>Scandal, ABC<br>Million Dollar Listing LA, Bravo<br>Being Mary Jane, BET<br>Staged to Perfection, HGTV<br>Beyond Hope, Al Diaz<br>Silicon Valley, HBO<br>The Laundromat (2019)<br>Love, Simon (2018)</p><p>COLLECTIONS<br>Capital One Headquarters, Los Angeles, CA<br>Brentwood Country Club, Los Angeles, CA<br>Ritz Carlton, Los Angeles, CA<br>Meredith Baer Home<br>Graeme Heart, New Zealand<br>Joey Restaurant, Manhattan Beach, CA<br>Kimpton Shinjuku Hotel, Tokyo<br>Aurora Capital, Los Angeles, CA<br>Epic Hotel, Miami, FL</p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Mixed Media, Acrylic, Latex, Spray Paint on Canvas''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=799&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2FbTyC7geiuXdxjt6xs3xayw%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=799')

She began painting as an outlet of grief; creating something beautiful as the result of loss. Through her creative practice, she has found healing and further offers to her community safe spaces for troubled teens and women to heal through the meditative process of painting. Her artworks are a language, a push forward in new directions and achievements, while always inspired by history. Berta mixes minimalism with underlying texture and embraces modernism while compiling the odds and ends of her attempts to let her art speak for itself.</p><p>Her abstract works often include reminders of her travels expressed in unexpected sequences of patterns as well as distortion of perspectives and subconscious spaces. Manipulating the texture with several layers of texture paste and acrylic paint, she will work and re-work her canvases, layering textures to give added dimension, and creating works that intrigue and invite the viewer to explore not only the surface but also the inner language of the painting.</p><p>A passionate, award-winning artist of Hungarian heritage, Clara Berta&#39;s dynamic and highly textural abstract works have been exhibited and collected worldwide.</p><p>SELECT EXHIBITIONS<br>2020 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2019 Bistango Restaurant with Ethos Contemporary, Irvine, CA<br>2019 MAC Fine Art, Ft.

Painted on a 1.5” gallery wrapped canvas with the edges painted white and finished with a coat of protective varnish, it comes ready to hang and signed on the front.

In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p><p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p><p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p><p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p><p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Industrial paint, spray paint, and oil pastel on paper''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=800&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F9CRGKa1iNltVlbkHTJWdSg%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=606')

This collection draws inspiration from the natural world ~ the contours of the land and hills, the sky’s atmosphere and cloud formations, the flow of the sea and rivers. These shapes and forms are abstracted to their energetic essence and combined with the vibrant colors that I love so much. Each unique painting has a modern minimal aesthetic in a wide array of energetic color palettes to add some fresh energy and vitality to any space. The sky glows in rich shades of orange and pink as the sun illuminates the clouds while setting in a vivid blue sky. There is a suggestion of distant hills above a body of water that lights up with a blue and orange glow. The vibrant colors create dynamic contrast giving both an energetic feeling combined with the calm tranquility of the water reflections. Painted on a 1.5” gallery wrapped canvas with the edges painted white and finished with a coat of protective varnish, it comes ready to hang and signed on the front. Thank you for your interest in my work.

On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p><p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate.

Bilal, who has been experimenting with paint since childhood, has developed a unique process of her own. She often paints while seated on the floor to pour her whole body into the composition, using her hands, mouth, and found objects to create an array of effects that become part of an intricate yet fluid work of art.<br>Bilal’s first solo show in New York City, Fingerprints of Ruh (2020), curated by Nemo Librizzi, was met with enthusiasm and led to gallery representation by Chase Contemporary Gallery and recently, Mazlish Gallery.<br>Dubbed “a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary art world” by Forbes Magazine, her work has captivated many.

This collection draws inspiration from the natural world ~ the contours of the land and hills, the sky’s atmosphere and cloud formations, the flow of the sea and rivers. These shapes and forms are abstracted to their energetic essence and combined with the vibrant colors that I love so much. Each unique painting has a modern minimal aesthetic in a wide array of energetic color palettes to add some fresh energy and vitality to any space. The sky glows in rich deep shades of yellow, orange, pink and purple as the sun illuminates the clouds while setting in the sky. There is a suggestion of distant hills above a field of deep green and reddish brown in the foreground. The warm and vibrant colors create dynamic contrast and an energetic pop of color to brighten any space.

She originally started painting with pigments, powders, and waxes and went on to experiment with different mediums and processes to keep evolving her artworks. As love and joy are paramount emotions in life, Goldhammer hopes her series incorporating the “I Love You” message expands to reach a wide audience. Connecting people through public art is one way she believes her street murals can impact lives, as it is impossible to view her work and not feel a sense of joy and love.</p><p>Painting a convergence of color and emotion, she builds and layers bold colors organically, allowing the process to determine the outcome. There is no analyzing, conceptualizing, or judging that takes place. It all happens in the moment, as a union between her, the canvas, and the paint. Amber Goldhammer frequently draws inspiration for her palette from the colors of the ocean, saying, “I get to take in the essence of the ocean every day, which fuels my creativity and brings me peace.”</p><p>A worldwide collected young artist with ongoing concurrent exhibitions in galleries throughout the United States and Switzerland, Goldhammer&#39;s artworks have also been exhibited at major international art fairs. Her original paintings have been showcased in print and online publications, and on such TV series as “Million Dollar Listing,” “Being Mary Jane,” “The Catch” as well as both multi-Emmy® nominated series, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”, and “Scandal.” Goldhammer’s art is also featured on Netflix’s original series, “G.L.O.W.” by “Weeds” creator, Jenji Kohan.</p><p>Artspace Warehouse has been representing and exhibiting Amber Goldhammer&#39;s original artworks since 2011.

Despite the heavily decorative, almost abstract use of flat colour, the artist picks out the accoutrements of contemporary Parisian fashions in the ladies’ large colourful hats, creating a scene that falls between the bucolic and the modern.</p><p>Roussel studied at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris in the 1880s where he met his lifelong friend, artistic partner and future brother-in-law, Edouard Vuillard. Roussel went on to study at the Académie Julian in Paris where he met Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard and Paul Sérusier, and along with Vuillard became part of the artistic group which became known as ‘Les Nabis’ or Prophets. The group were highly influenced by Gauguin and sought to push art beyond the objectivity of Impressionism, to create to imagery that looked beyond visual reality to create a synthesis of colour, form and spiritual feeling. </p><p>The Nabis were particularly inspired by Japanese woodcuts and its use of flat, bold areas of colours, which can be seen in &#39;Le Pique-nique des Roussel à L’Etang-la-Ville&#39;. In this work Roussel also uses the colour and texture of the bare paper as an active ingredient in the work, which gives the artwork a sense of lightness and freedom of design, as well as a rejection of traditional artistic illusionism. Famously Denis announced ‘remember that a picture, before being a battle horse, a female nude or some sort of anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain order’ in his original Nabis manifesto and we see these ideals presented in the present work by Roussel.</p><p>Roussel’s work originally sold by legendary galleries such as Galerie Vollard and Galerie Bernheim-Jeune and his pastoral scenes are currently the subject of an exhibition at the Musée des Impressionnismes Giverny ‘Ker-Xavier Roussel. Private Garden, Dreamed Garden.’ The artist has also had a major international exhibitions at the Musée de l’Orangerie, Paris, The Institute of Arts, Minneapolis and the Haus der Kunst, Munich amongst others and his works are held in public collections across France. </p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Pastel on cardboard''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=601&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2FKoBvuf1_ZZUwm3INGtmT1w%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=800')

Keifer brings a fresh perspective to her colorful scenes of everyday life in the sun along the Pacific coastline (and beyond). Her detailed paintings show us the breathtaking California scenery with its recognizable elements in a new light and with a keen eye for clever composition and layered colors. Her modern landscapes and sublime seascapes capture an impressive visceral visual.</p><p>This one-of-a-kind 30-inch high by 15-inch wide and 1.5-inch deep original artwork is a composition created with acrylic paint on canvas. It is stretched, wired, and ready to hang. The sides are painted as a continuation of the front and it does not require framing. It is signed by the artist on the front of the artwork. A certificate of authenticity issued by the gallery is included. Convenient local Los Angeles area shipping. Affordable Continental U.S. and global shipping also available. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p><p>Kathleen Keifer is a California-based internationally collected artist. Her paintings invite the viewer to consider the complex relationship between time and timelessness. It is the sheer visual interaction between the elements, taken in their bare simplicity that interests her. Water, sky, and architecture change their appearance with the shifts in weather and light. Her broken brushstrokes depict light and color in luminous waves, dissolving form into a shimmering surface of vibrant light. For her, painting captures the very essence of time and its passage.</p><p>While painting landscapes she became fascinated with isolating the objects in her paintings. She believes that actual sites and places have individual magic. The goal is to take objects from popular culture and paint them in a new context. She began to paint the silhouette of the Life Guard Tower more as a pop art symbol than a landscape element. With a high level of technical virtuosity, Keifer creates a new sense of reality with textures and colors that seem to add lighting effects and distinct shadows, confronting the viewer with new interpretations of familiar objects.</p><p>Born and raised in Chicago, Kathleen Keifer is a second-generation artist. Her mother, also a fine artist, exposed Keifer to the world of art and supervised her training from a very early age. This legacy continues today as Keifer closely nurtures the development of the artistic leaning in each of her three daughters, inspiring a third generation of female artists. Her works are represented by Artspace Warehouse Los Angeles and have been exhibited and collected internationally, including Chicago, New York, and London.</p><p>SELECT EXHIBITIONS<br>2020 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2017 Affordable Art Fair New York, NY<br>Affordable Art Fair London, UK<br>Art Palm Springs, CA<br>2016 Along the PCH, Susan Schomburg gallery, Santa Monica, CA<br>Jazz in the Pines, Idyllwild, CA<br>2015 Official artist of Chitag, Chicago Toy and Game Fair, Chicago, Il<br>Jazz!

In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p><p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p><p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p><p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p><p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>', '''Includes gouache; fresco; ink and wash; oil painting; screen painting; scroll painting; tempera; watercolor.''', '''Industrial paint, spray paint, and oil pastel on canvas''', 'https://d7hftxdivxxvm.cloudfront.net?height=800&quality=80&resize_to=fit&src=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F0WqQzOVgZztxUSYdJhlx5g%2Fnormalized.jpg&width=795')

She is a leading force of the New California Realism. With a high level of technical virtuosity Keifer creates a new sense of reality with textures and colors that seem to add lighting effects and distinct shadows, confronting the viewer with new interpretations of familiar objects.</p><p>This one-of-a-kind 12 inch square and 1.5-inch deep original artwork is a composition created with acrylic paint on canvas. It is wired and ready to hang. The sides are painted as a continuation of the front and it does not require framing. It signed by the artist on the front of the artwork. Convenient local Los Angeles area shipping. Affordable Continental U.S. and global shipping also available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p><p>Kathleen’s paintings invite the viewer to consider the complex relationship between time and timelessness. It is the sheer visual interaction between the elements, taken in their bare simplicity that interests her. For her, painting captures the very essence of time and its passage. She believes that actual sites and places have an individual magic. The goal is to take objects from popular culture and paint them in a new narrative context. Her complex approaches to popular board games present the subjects as living, tangible objects.</p><p>Born and raised in Chicago, Kathleen Keifer is a second-generation artist. Her mother, also a fine artist, exposed Keifer to the world of art and supervised her training from a very early age. This legacy continues today as Keifer closely nurtures the development of the artistic leaning in each of her three daughters, inspiring a third generation of female artists. Her works are represented by Artspace Warehouse Los Angeles and have been exhibited and collected internationally, including Chicago, New York and London.</p><p>Education and Honors<br>B.F.A.

This collection draws inspiration from the natural world ~ the contours of the land and hills, the sky’s atmosphere and cloud formations, the flow of the sea and rivers. These shapes and forms are abstracted to their energetic essence and combined with the vibrant colors that I love so much. Each unique painting has a modern minimal aesthetic in a wide array of energetic color palettes to add some fresh energy and vitality to any space. The sky glows in soft shades of orange, pink and purple as the sun illuminates the clouds while setting in the sky. A thin strip of water is lit up with a reddish glow being framed by distant hills and the shoreline above a rich brown foreground. It captures the magical feeling of twilight, where the light softens and warms at the end of the day. The rich warm colors create a calm and soothing feeling combined with the peaceful tranquility of the water reflections.
