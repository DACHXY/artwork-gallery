    "additionalInformation": "<p>This work is accompanied by a copy of certification of authenticity from Robert Descharnes (Ref# D-968). This is one of the most impressive and moving works Spanish Master Salvador Dali (1904-1989) created as an homage to the great Spanish master Diego Velasquez, whom Dali revered. Master Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez (nee. Diego Velasquez). Velasquez (1599-1660) was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV. He is considered the most important painter of the Spanish Golden Age. Dali stated &quot;I [Dali] am not a good painter, because I am too intelligent to be a good painter. To be a good painter you&#39;ve got to be a bit stupid, with the exception of Velasquez, who is a genius whose talent surpasses the art of painting and to life. I owe everything. Because the day that Dali paints a picture as good as Velasquez, Vermeer or Raphael... The next week he will die. So I prefer to paint bad pictures and live longer&quot;.</p>\n<p>Velasquez&#39;s towering masterpiece &quot;Las Meninas&quot; (1656), primarily depicts the infanta Margarita surrounded by maids and chaperones beside the painter himself working on a large canvas. The painting&#39;s mind-bending affects place the viewer in the viewpoint of the King and Queen (who are reflected in the mirror on the far wall) while being painted by Velasquez and attended by their daughter. A mysterious man lingers in the background. The painting, which hung in Spain&#39;s Museo Nacional del Prado during the lifetime of Dali, became a pilgrimage point any aspiring artist would undertake for intensive study. Velasquez&#39;s profound influence is found in Dali&#39;s paintings such as Velázquez Painting the Infanta Margarita with the Lights and Shadows of His Own Glory (1958), The Maids of Honour (Las Meninas) (1960), and Portrait of Juan de Pareja repairing a mandolin string (1960). In 1960 he took part in a group exhibition at the Sala Gaspar Gallery in Barcelona, entitled O figura. Homenaje informal a Velázquez, with a text that praises Velazquez, illustrated with a reproduction of Las Meninas. At the end of that same year he organized an exhibition at the Carstairs Gallery in New York under the title The Secret Number of Velázquez Revealed.</p>\n",

In Pressure, the artist intended to communicate a sense of oppression with the weight of an imposing skyscraper exerting a force on the brooding figure below, Robert Longo.<br>In the present work, the artist inverts the concept, suggesting that man isn&#39;t the only one oppressed; heaven and god are as well.<br>Measurements:<br>Framed:<br>34.5 inches x 49 inches x 1.25<br>Artwork:<br>29.75 inches x 43.25 inches</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Isaac Israëls<br>1865-1934 | Dutch</p>\n<p>The Royal Stock Exchange</p>\n<p>Signed &quot;Isaac Israels&quot; (lower right)<br>Oil on canvas</p>\n<p>Isaac Israëls&#39; The Royal Stock Exchange offers a compelling perspective of the preeminent economic institution at the turn of the century. The bustling streets of Cornhill and Threadneedle, filled with London&#39;s iconic double-decker buses, converge towards the pinnacle of the renowned building, receding into the bright background. Israëls was known for riding double-decker buses, which allowed him to enjoy the city from an elevated vantage point. The unique point-of-view of The Royal Stock Exchange invites viewers to experience a transient moment as a tourist in the center of the city, above the bustling crowds.</p>\n<p>Born in Amsterdam in 1865, Isaac Israëls was a prodigious artist who demonstrated innate talent from a young age, much like his esteemed father, Jozef Israëls, a prominent member of the influential Hague School. Often called the &quot;Amsterdam Impressionist,&quot; his association with the renowned Tachtigers, a group of Dutch artists and intellectuals, had a profound impact on his artistic vision. Sharing the belief that form must harmonize with content, the Tachtigers nurtured Israëls&#39; development of a highly evocative and emotive style that perfectly complemented his emotionally charged subjects. While Israëls was identified as an Impressionist during his time, his distinctive technique, reminiscent of the master Paul Cézanne, was characterized by bold painterly brushstrokes, rich color palettes and a meticulous spatial arrangement, setting him apart as a masterful artist of his era.</p>\n<p>Early in his career, Israëls exhibited a keen eye for capturing the vibrancy of Amsterdam&#39;s streets and cabarets, skillfully portraying the energy and atmosphere of urban life with remarkable artistry. Drawn by the allure of Paris, he eventually made Montmartre his home, immersing himself in the vibrant artistic community alongside luminaries such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas. In this dynamic environment, Israëls&#39; mastery of his style emerged, fueled by his deep appreciation for modern city life.</p>\n<p>In 1911, Israëls experienced his father&#39;s death, which led him to seek solace abroad. Reluctant to return to his homeland, he moved to London in 1913. Inspired by the bustling streets of West End, the lively pedestrians along the Thames and the iconic landmarks of Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street, as well as ballet students, Israëls found abundant creative inspiration in his new surroundings. Israëls&#39; paintings of London, including this very work, are highly regarded for their energy and spirit. Considered rare gems in his oeuvre, his delightful creations perfectly capture the essence of London&#39;s dynamic vitality in the years before the onset of the First World War.</p>\n<p>During his lifetime, Israëls regularly exhibited at the Paris Salon and was celebrated for his ability to capture the beauty of everyday life in a way that was both poetic and poignant. His paintings are housed in the collections of prestigious museums worldwide, including the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and the Brooklyn Museum. His oeuvre was prominently showcased in the Kunstmuseum Den Haag’s 2008-2009 exhibition Jozef and Isaac Israëls. </p>\n<p>Circa 1913-1914</p>\n",

Still lifes are a pivotal subject in the painting of every century, with which all artists have been confronted. Salvo also grapples with this subject, and he does so through his pictorial language, his unique technique, and his approach to colour. This subject suffers from a chromatic balance desired by the artist with colours chasing each other from the foreground to the background, from the flowers to the diagonal line dividing the space - perhaps the edge of a table. The contrast between the essential dimension and the refinement of the flower vase, with its details, brings back both Salvo&#39;s pictorial approach and the strong poetics of the artist, an Italian master of painting.<br>This work has a great exhibition history in museums and galleries, from Milan to MACRO Rome, from Bergamo to Verbania Villa Giulia.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Tanc&#39;s work bears the clear influence of abstract expressionist artists (the artist talks about Rothko, Pollock, Reinhardt, Hartung and especially Franz Kline are sources of inspiration in his practice). Tanc&#39;s practice reached a turning point: ever since his New York show at Catherine Ahnell Gallery, the artist left aside the colorful explosion that used to mark his paintings and is now more interested in nuances of black, lineary variations and automatic writing. This new direction evokes the work of Henri Michaux. Tanc is also a composer and certain notions from the electronic and experimental music inhabit his work, without any doubt; the obsession for rhythm and pulsation tend to produce an intense, fascinating painting with a unique vibrating dimension. He has shows in France regularly, but colorful or grey, his work has gained international prominence with exhibitions in Germany (Skalitzers Contemporary Art), in the UK (The French Art Studio), Morocco (David Bloch Gallery) or New York (Catherine Ahnell Gallery). He is one of the most promising artists of his generation.</p>\n<p>About the artwork: </p>\n<p>While the manuscript nowadays tends to disappear, Tanc explores the aesthetic dimension of writing. Inspired by his high school years, when he took notes and produced pages as illegible as they seemed nice, he develops a system of automatic writing, executed entirely with spray paint, halfway between calligraphy and graffiti. The viewer may find meaning or even words, but the aim is not to read but feel the rhythm of writing. Large size and often monochrome works let perceive new forms, a new alphabet. We do not know if the writing goes from left to right or vice versa. Mid-abstract, semi-figurative, each piece is designed as a landscape, with an accumulation of lines that end up creating a horizon. Aided by glow and matte effects that gloss paint gives in some places on the canvas, this new series is about rhythm and frequencies, revealing a music in which the eye can get lost and escape.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Salvo Foundation archive number S1979-12.<br>&#39;Senza titolo&#39; is one of Salvo&#39;s first landscapes where the protagonists are snow, trees and nature. A winter landscape, where one already has the typical perspective of the artist moving from the foreground towards the central vanishing point, following a winding road covered in white. In the distance, a village where the presence of man is absent: one can feel the cluster of houses in the distance but there is no one &#39;living&#39; the space. The style does not yet have that essentiality that characterises the artist&#39;s maturity: the details are still present in the windows of the houses, in the church bell tower and in the sinuosity of the trees; the colour is played on contrasts and matter.<br>Salvo&#39;s landscapes continue to break sales records: this is a collector&#39;s subject, historical and museum subject, refined and elegant.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>This pair of rare earthenware horses hails from the powerful Tang Dynasty of China. The dynasty reigned for nearly 300 years between the 7th and 10th centuries CE, and oversaw a cultural and artistic “golden age” in Chinese civilization. Remnants of paints and other pigments remain visible along the horses’ flanks and legs, indicating the sculptures were once sumptuously colored and glazed. The stoic equines each take a bold striding stance, forming a perfect pair.</p>\n<p>Horses held a special significance in Tang China, in part due to a particular affection of the second Tang ruler, Emperor Taizong. He was deeply devoted to his beloved horse “Autumn Dew,” who he credited with saving his life during a pivotal battle to unify China under the emperor’s reign. Horses’ continued importance in Tang expansion and military might made the animal a strong symbol of imperial power and wealth. </p>\n<p>Tang Dynasty funerary sculpture, known as mingqi, reflect a harmonious blend of Han Chinese traditions and external cultural influences arriving to China through the Silk Road. More than a facilitator of global commercial transactions, the Silk Road served as a network for cultural exchange between East Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and beyond. Along its routes, travelers and merchants from disparate cultures encountered one another, fostering the exchange of ideas, philosophies, art forms and scientific knowledge. Mingqi such as these, which highlight animals that facilitated travel and trade, were intended to accompany and serve the deceased in the afterlife, and frequently depict guardian figures and the pack animals that were essential in the ever-expanding world.</p>\n<p>Circa 7th-10th century CE</p>\n<p>22 1/2“ high x 21 1/4” wide x 6“ deep each</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>The artist explains you his artwork :<br> &quot;This “Sunset as the Fall Approaches” print is inspired by a beautiful but ominous sunset I photographed, along with the jarring juxtaposition of oil drilling platforms off the coast of Santa Barbara. In 1969 the largest (at the time) oil spill happened at the Union Oil platform near Santa Barbara. The environmental devastation was significant enough to spark a movement and several pieces of environmental regulation. In the Santa Barbara spill, the damage from oil was painfully visible in the dead seabirds, dolphins, and other wildlife. What was not directly visible and what scientists were only beginning to determine was the effects of burning oil, gas, and coal on global temperatures. There is a delicate balance that maintains the ecosystems of Earth’s most beautiful spaces and habitats of all its creatures. I’d like to see those things not in their twilight but preserved for future generations. A portion of proceeds from this print went to Greenpeace USA to support their efforts to combat climate change. Thanks for caring.&quot;<br> – Shepard Fairey</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>STARSKY BRINE’s paintings and drawings captivate audiences with their distinctive style and a recurring theme, the search for the nature of humanity. In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p>\n<p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p>\n<p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p>\n<p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>STARSKY BRINE’s paintings and drawings captivate audiences with their distinctive style and a recurring theme, the search for the nature of humanity. In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p>\n<p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p>\n<p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p>\n<p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>\n",

The variety of shapes are incredibly magical and abstract, while simultaneously domestic and familiar. His functional forms vary, but can range from mirrors to tables and chairs. Oskar&#39;s work is at home in contemporary architectural spaces as well as more traditional buildings, elevating the space with its lofty design.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Clara Berta’s acrylic and mixed-media paintings blend texture and color to create harmony, mystery, and depth on the painted surface. Her paintings transform spaces into Zen environments where one can quiet a cluttered mind and enjoy beauty every day. Clara Berta’s paintings explore themes such as the ebb and flow of memory, the significance of personal heritage, the passing of physical time, desire, grief, and love.</p>\n<p>This large artwork measures 48 inches high by 72 inches wide. The sides of this abstract original artwork are painted white. It is stretched, wired, and ready to hang. It is signed and titled by the artist on the back. Free local Los Angeles area delivery. Affordable Continental U.S. and worldwide shipping available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Clara Berta explores the collision between the old and new; destruction and rebuilding lives. She began painting as an outlet of grief; creating something beautiful as the result of loss. Through her creative practice, she has found healing and further offers to her community safe spaces for troubled teens and women to heal through the meditative process of painting. Her artworks are a language, a push forward in new directions and achievements, while always inspired by history. Berta mixes minimalism with underlying texture and embraces modernism while compiling the odds and ends of her attempts to let her art speak for itself.</p>\n<p>Her abstract works often include reminders of her travels expressed in unexpected sequences of patterns as well as distortion of perspectives and subconscious spaces. Manipulating the texture with several layers of texture paste and acrylic paint, she will work and re-work her canvases, layering textures to give added dimension, and creating works that intrigue and invite the viewer to explore not only the surface but also the inner language of the painting.</p>\n<p>A passionate, award-winning artist of Hungarian heritage, Clara Berta&#39;s dynamic and highly textural abstract works have been exhibited and collected worldwide.</p>\n<p>SELECT EXHIBITIONS<br>2020 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2019 Bistango Restaurant with Ethos Contemporary, Irvine, CA<br>2019 MAC Fine Art, Ft.

Inspired by the vibrant surroundings she found growing up on the Mediterranean and the Southern Californian Coast, Phillips is driven by the philosophy of “color is life”. Her works have been influenced by impressionism and the geometric nature of graphic design.</p>\n<p>This one-of-a-kind textural painting on canvas measures 60 inches high by 12 inches wide. It is wired and ready to hang. It does not require framing. It is signed by the artist on the side and back. Convenient local Los Angeles area shipping. Affordable Continental U.S. and worldwide shipping also available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included with this original artwork. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>The tactile quality of the texture in Phillips&#39; artworks adds depth and contrast, movement, and rhythm. “My art is paired with intent, delivering pieces that hope to give the viewer the comfort of structure, along with the emotional release of abstraction. By overlaying the various mediums in an abstracted or impressionistic way, I hope to create a unique and vivid experience for the viewer.”</p>\n<p>Born in Los Angeles, Phillips relocated to Israel at an early age and returned to the United States to finally settle in Omaha, Nebraska. Phillips has made a strong and swift impact since she started exhibiting her artworks. Her international experiences shape her colorful paintings. Her rapidly growing collector base shares her love for artworks that burst with energy beyond the canvas to fill any space with positivity and joy. Within a short time her works have already been exhibited in galleries and art fairs throughout the United States, including in New York and Los Angeles.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>In 1970, having won the prestigious Cite des Artes scholarship, Charles Blackman escaped Australia for Paris. He immediately fell in love with the city, commencing what art historians refer to as his “Golden Era” for drawing. Blackman immersed himself in Parisian culture, setting out to become a “serious” artist by mastering the nude. </p>\n<p>Captured in confident, bold lines, ‘Standing Nude’ comes from this era. It recalls Kenneth Clark’s famous delineation between naked and nude — the former denoting the unclothed, the latter a loaded concept, aesthetic and convention. The nude, Clark argued, was not a subject in art “but a form” and any good artist must wrangle it to progress in their practice. </p>\n<p>Sensual, minimal and elegant, ‘Standing Nude’ sees Blackman dance with art history. It is a personal expression of creative sophistication, liberated from the shackles of Australia and social conservatism, while also recalling the complex position nudes hold — at once mythological and intimate, caught between strength and vulnerability. </p>\n<p>Signed and provenanced from the Charles Blackman Foundation, the highly collectable charcoal drawing pulls the viewer back to the city of love. It will bewitch collectors of Blackman, modern art and nudes. </p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Los Angeles artist Amber Goldhammer paints dramatic abstract compositions in acrylic on canvas featuring energetic brushstrokes. Goldhammer uses her contemporary paintings to express emotions akin to silent poetry while drawing inspiration for her palette from the layered world around her. Her artworks include layered textures and playful details along the surfaces.</p>\n<p>This original graffiti-inspired painting measures 18-inches square. The sides are painted grey and it does not require framing. It is wired and ready to hang. This painting is signed and titled by the artist on the back. Convenient local Los Angeles area shipping. Affordable Continental U.S. and global shipping also available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Amber Goldhammer is best known for creating vibrant abstract paintings with a street art edge. She originally started painting with pigments, powders, and waxes and went on to experiment with different mediums and processes to keep evolving her artworks. As love and joy are paramount emotions in life, Goldhammer hopes her series incorporating the “I Love You” message expands to reach a wide audience. Connecting people through public art is one way she believes her street murals can impact lives, as it is impossible to view her work and not feel a sense of joy and love.</p>\n<p>Painting a convergence of color and emotion, she builds and layers bold colors organically, allowing the process to determine the outcome. There is no analyzing, conceptualizing, or judging that takes place. It all happens in the moment, as a union between her, the canvas, and the paint. Amber Goldhammer frequently draws inspiration for her palette from the colors of the ocean, saying, “I get to take in the essence of the ocean every day, which fuels my creativity and brings me peace.”</p>\n<p>A worldwide collected young artist with ongoing concurrent exhibitions in galleries throughout the United States and Switzerland, Goldhammer&#39;s artworks have also been exhibited at major international art fairs. Her original paintings have been showcased in print and online publications, and on such TV series as “Million Dollar Listing,” “Being Mary Jane,” “The Catch” as well as both multi-Emmy® nominated series, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”, and “Scandal.” Goldhammer’s art is also featured on Netflix’s original series, “G.L.O.W.” by “Weeds” creator, Jenji Kohan.</p>\n<p>Artspace Warehouse has been representing and exhibiting Amber Goldhammer&#39;s original artworks since 2011.

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Tanc&#39;s work bears the clear influence of abstract expressionist artists (the artist talks about Rothko, Pollock, Reinhardt, Hartung and especially Franz Kline are sources of inspiration in his practice). Tanc&#39;s practice reached a turning point: ever since his New York show at Catherine Ahnell Gallery, the artist left aside the colorful explosion that used to mark his paintings and is now more interested in nuances of black, lineary variations and automatic writing. This new direction evokes the work of Henri Michaux. Tanc is also a composer and certain notions from the electronic and experimental music inhabit his work, without any doubt; the obsession for rhythm and pulsation tend to produce an intense, fascinating painting with a unique vibrating dimension. He has shows in France regularly, but colorful or grey, his work has gained international prominence with exhibitions in Germany (Skalitzers Contemporary Art), in the UK (The French Art Studio), Morocco (David Bloch Gallery) or New York (Catherine Ahnell Gallery). He is one of the most promising artists of his generation.</p>\n<p>About the artwork: </p>\n<p>While the manuscript nowadays tends to disappear, Tanc explores the aesthetic dimension of writing. Inspired by his high school years, when he took notes and produced pages as illegible as they seemed nice, he develops a system of automatic writing, executed entirely with spray paint, halfway between calligraphy and graffiti. The viewer may find meaning or even words, but the aim is not to read but feel the rhythm of writing. Large size and often monochrome works let perceive new forms, a new alphabet. We do not know if the writing goes from left to right or vice versa. Mid-abstract, semi-figurative, each piece is designed as a landscape, with an accumulation of lines that end up creating a horizon. Aided by glow and matte effects that gloss paint gives in some places on the canvas, this new series is about rhythm and frequencies, revealing a music in which the eye can get lost and escape.</p>\n",

Along with 3D Rat, a spate of other street art pieces including Cameraman and Flower and a giant Banksy tag across a billboard also appeared to coincide with the World premier of the Banksy film “Exit Through The Gift Shop”. </p>\n<p>Synonymous with many of the artist’s most famous works, rats as a subject matter have served to propel Banksy to becoming the most in-demand and collectable artist in the world. In today’s blog, we examine the seminal work 3D Rat with Glasses and Fly. </p>\n<p>In 3D Rat with Glasses and Fly we see a stylised rat, with beautiful grey and black tones, raised on its hindlegs admiring a swarm of flies that burst out of the image and onto the artist’s frame. The flimsy plastic glasses with their red and blue lenses use special photographs called anaglyph images, creating the illusion of depth. Here, Banksy creates the illusion of depth in the work with the fly escaping from the background of the board onto the foreground of the frame. </p>\n<p>Indeed, the Sundance works, or even Banksy’s other street art, can be seen as advertisements for the artist. Here we see a clever cat and mouse as the artist wrestles with the desire to create and to share his vision of and with the world whilst bringing the works to the attention of the public and promoting the film. The works themselves, in Utah, becoming the new trailers ahead of the premiere of “Exit Through The Gift Shop”. </p>\n",

In this collection, Warhol takes the ever-present American pantry staple and transforms it into high art simply by exactly mimicking the cans’ label. The second portfolio contains ten of the more unusual flavors from the original 32 that Warhol created in 1962, which were all real flavors of Campbell’s Soup cans. These ten prints are slightly more unique than those in the first print portfolio because of the more unusual flavors and added graphics on their labels, which make them visually stand out.</p>\n<p>CAMPBELL’S SOUP II: SCOTCH BROTH 55 AS PART OF ANDY WARHOL’S LARGER BODY OF WORK<br>Warhol’s collection of prints representing Campbell’s Soup cans is arguably his most iconic and widely recognized series of artwork. The Campbell’s Soup portfolios represent many themes that Warhol continues to work with throughout his career, including the powerful role that mass consumption plays on postwar society. The semi-mechanized process he used to create his works is something that is characterized with Warhol. His Campbell’s Soup series helped to usher in the Pop Art movement that endures today, renewed and rediscovered by artists such as Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>This majestic early Romare Bearden graphite, watercolor ink, photomontage and paper collage - &quot;African Royalty&quot; - was recently included in the acclaimed exhibition, &quot;Songs Without Words: The Art of Music, November 20, 2021 – March 6, 2022&quot; at the Nassau Museum in New York. (see attached installation photographs) It is from the Estate of Alma LeBrecht and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts. (LeBrecht was a longtime drawing instructor at the MFA). The verso of the work bears the original documentation card from the museum noting this is Study No. 1 for a proposed lithograph, and indicates the proposed measurements. &quot;African Royalty&quot; was created during the same period as Bearden’s celebrated work “Watching the Good Train Go By” – a photomontage – i.e. a collage that includes photographs. According to the National Gallery of Art, “In Watching the Good Train Go By, Bearden used photographs to create cut out pictures of trains, faces, and arms, combined with patterned papers, creating a busy scene. Bearden’s art was influenced by his love for jazz and the blues. Music was often the subject of his work, and it also influenced his way of working. One distinguishing feature of jazz is improvisation...Bearden advised a younger artist to “become a blues singer—only you sing on the canvas. You improvise—you find the rhythm and catch it good, and structure as you go along—then the song is you…”<br>According to press materials from Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, which in 2011 hosted a critically acclaimed exhibition of other Bearden collages, the artist believed that “art is made from other art: ..” This idea is literally present in the act of collage-making—taking images, colors, and forms out of one context, altering them, and juxtaposing them with other pre-existing images, colors, and forms to create something new. But it is equally apparent in Bearden’s celebration of jazz and blues, the inspiration he drew from African art, and his passion for telling the stories and representing the cultures of ordinary black Americans...”<br>In a 2011 New York Times review, critic Roberta Smith wrote, “Romare Bearden (1911-88) spent more than 30 years striving to be a great artist, and in the early 1960s, when he took up collage in earnest, he became one. As historical shows go, this one feels unusually of-the-moment. For one thing the improvisational cross-fertilizing of art mediums that Bearden helped pioneer via collage is more and more the norm; for another, paper has probably never been more popular as an art material, for work in both two and three dimensions. .. Bearden took up collage sometime in the late 1950s, after a relatively fallow period during which what little painting he made was mostly abstract. A trip to France and Italy with his wife in 1961, to see many of the museums and churches he had visited 10 years before while studying painting on the G.I. Bill of Rights, may have reconnected him to figuration. In 1963 he helped organize Spiral, a group of African-American artists interested in finding new ways to portray black life in America. Bearden suggested that the group collaborate on collage, an implicitly collaborative medium. This didn’t happen, but evidently he found his métier in the process of demonstrating the possibilities. By then Bearden was in his early 50s, a late bloomer by most standards. But… his collages have a pictorial sophistication, cultural erudition and emotional wisdom that it is hard to imagine in a younger artist. They are full-flavored distillations of the culturally rich, occasionally privileged life Bearden had led up that point: his experience of black life growing up in the South and then in Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance; his immersion in jazz and African sculpture; his study at the Art Students League with George Grosz; his stint as a political cartoonist with a Baltimore newspaper (during which he did extensive research on the history of cartooning); his friendships with artists white and black, including Stuart Davis, Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis and William H. Johnson; his familiarity with the evolution of the New York School painting and its Cubist roots; and his experience, stretching over more than 30 years, of observing urban life up close while supporting himself as a social worker in New York City… But by the late 1960s Bearden was subjecting collage to various mechanical and hands-on manipulations. These included rephotographing (via photostat) and enlarging his own collages for further use, a practice pursued by artists from the outsider Henry Darger (whose work had not yet been rediscovered at the time) to budding appropriationists like Richard Prince and Barbara Kruger, starting in the mid ’70s. “Watching the Good Train Go By,” [later scholarship has documented that work as done in 1964], with its group of colorfully clothed figures, is actually a collage on top of an earlier rephotographed collage. If you look closely, images that appear to be pieced together lack the telltale seams..”</p>\n<p>&quot;African Royalty&quot; is elegantly floated and framed with a die-cut back to reveal the museum card with the artists name and information; it also bears an exhibition label from the Nassau Museum of Art.

    "additionalInformation": "<p>The Banksy artwork &quot;Girl with Balloon&quot; is a famous piece of street art that features a young girl reaching out for a heart-shaped balloon that is floating away from her. The image first appeared on a wall in London in 2002, and has since become one of Banksy&#39;s most iconic works.</p>\n<p>In 2018, a framed print of &quot;Girl with Balloon&quot; was sold at a Sotheby&#39;s auction for over a million pounds, and immediately after the hammer came down, the artwork started to self-destruct. The bottom part of the artwork passed through a shredder hidden inside the frame, much to the surprise of the auction-goers and the art world.</p>\n<p>This self-destructing artwork was later renamed &quot;Love is in the Bin&quot; by Banksy and is considered by many as a new artwork. The incident brought even more attention to Banksy&#39;s work and the value of his art in the auction market.</p>\n<p>The imagery of the girl and the balloon has been interpreted in many ways, with some seeing it as a symbol of innocence, childhood, or the fleeting nature of happiness. Banksy is known for his thought-provoking and politically-charged works, and &quot;Girl with Balloon&quot; is no exception.</p>\n",

Her artworks include layered textures and playful details along the surfaces.</p>\n<p>This large original graffiti-inspired painting measures 36-inches high by 72-inch wide. The sides are painted grey and it does not require framing. It is wired and ready to hang. This painting is signed and titled by the artist on the back. Free local Los Angeles area delivery. Affordable Continental U.S. and global shipping available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Amber Goldhammer is best known for creating vibrant abstract paintings with a street art edge. She originally started painting with pigments, powders, and waxes and went on to experiment with different mediums and processes to keep evolving her artworks. As love and joy are paramount emotions in life, Goldhammer hopes her series incorporating the “I Love You” message expands to reach a wide audience. Connecting people through public art is one way she believes her street murals can impact lives, as it is impossible to view her work and not feel a sense of joy and love.</p>\n<p>Painting a convergence of color and emotion, she builds and layers bold colors organically, allowing the process to determine the outcome. There is no analyzing, conceptualizing, or judging that takes place. It all happens in the moment, as a union between her, the canvas, and the paint. Amber Goldhammer frequently draws inspiration for her palette from the colors of the ocean, saying, “I get to take in the essence of the ocean every day, which fuels my creativity and brings me peace.”</p>\n<p>A worldwide collected young artist with ongoing concurrent exhibitions in galleries throughout the United States and Switzerland, Goldhammer&#39;s artworks have also been exhibited at major international art fairs. Her original paintings have been showcased in print and online publications, and on such TV series as “Million Dollar Listing,” “Being Mary Jane,” “The Catch” as well as both multi-Emmy® nominated series, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”, and “Scandal.” Goldhammer’s art is also featured on Netflix’s original series, “G.L.O.W.” by “Weeds” creator, Jenji Kohan.</p>\n<p>SOLO EXHIBITIONS<br>2021 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA, USA<br>2020 Christopher Martin Gallery, Dallas, TX, USA<br>2012 Meridian’s, Ventura, CA, USA<br>2010 Healing Bodywork, Santa Monica, CA, USA</p>\n<p>GROUP EXHIBITIONS<br>2022 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA, USA<br>2020 Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>2020 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA, USA<br>2020 Kevin Barry Fine Art, Las Vegas, NV<br>2020 Ethos Contemporary, Newport Beach, CA<br>2020 Christopher Martin Gallery, Dallas, TX<br>2019 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2019 Kevin Barry Fine Art, Las Vegas, NV<br>2019 Ethos Contemporary, Newport Beach, CA<br>2018 Artspace Warehouse - Los Angeles, CA<br>2017 Jackson Gallery – Palm Springs, CA<br>2017 Kevin Barry Fine Art – San Francisco, CA<br>2017 Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>2015 Artspace Warehouse - Los Angeles, CA<br>2015 JCC Gallery - Santa Barbara, CA<br>2015 Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>2015 Michael Kate Design - Santa Barbara, CA<br>2014 National Peace Project – USA<br>2014 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2014 Burbank Creative Arts Center, Burbank, CA<br>2013 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2012 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2012 Artlife Gallery, El Segundo, CA<br>2012 Encino Community Center, Encino, CA</p>\n<p>ART FAIRS<br>2021 AAF New York, NY<br>2020 LA Art Show, CA<br>2020 Art Palm Springs, CA<br>2019 AAF New York, NY<br>2019 Art Palm Springs, CA<br>2018 AAF New York, NY<br>2018 AAF Hong Kong<br>2017 AAF New York, NY<br>2016 AAF Hong Kong<br>2016 AAF New York, NY<br>2015 AAF New York, NY<br>2014 Love Art Fair Toronto, Canada<br>2013 Affordable Art Fair New York, NY<br>2013 Affordable Art Fair Seattle, WA</p>\n<p>REPRESENTATIONS<br>Kunstwarenhaus Zurich, Switzerland<br>Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, USA</p>\n<p>PRESS<br>2015 Scene Magazine - Santa Barbara, Ca<br>2014 Avant Garde Magazine – Nationwide (USA)<br>2013 Blick Winter Catalog<br>2013 Fusionart, Rassouli<br>2011 Origin Magazine – Nationwide (USA)</p>\n<p>TV &amp; FILM<br>Insecure, HBO<br>GLOW, Netflix<br>L.A.’s Finest, Netflix<br>Planet of the Apps, Apple TV<br>The Catch, ABC<br>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, CW<br>Scandal, ABC<br>Million Dollar Listing LA, Bravo<br>Being Mary Jane, BET<br>Staged to Perfection, HGTV<br>Beyond Hope, Al Diaz<br>Silicon Valley, HBO<br>The Laundromat (2019)<br>Love, Simon (2018)</p>\n<p>COLLECTIONS<br>Capital One Headquarters, Los Angeles, CA<br>Brentwood Country Club, Los Angeles, CA<br>Ritz Carlton, Los Angeles, CA<br>Meredith Baer Home<br>Graeme Heart, New Zealand<br>Joey Restaurant, Manhattan Beach, CA<br>Kimpton Shinjuku Hotel, Tokyo<br>Aurora Capital, Los Angeles, CA<br>Epic Hotel, Miami, FL</p>\n",

Yet, amidst her fervent prayers, she grapples with a sense of silence, questioning if words carried any weight at all.<br>Adebayo ponders the depths of her relationship with the divine, wondering if communication lines with Jehovah were still intact, &quot;I was calling on God and still could not hear myself and I wondered if I was saying anything at all. Jehovah, are we still in speaking terms?”.<br>This artwork encapsulates the raw emotion and introspection that accompanied the artist’s spiritual journey, inviting viewers to reflect upon their own connections and the nature of divine communication.</p>\n",

His artistic journey begins in the harsh lands where he grew up.</p>\n<p>His work is a personal and intimate vision of the natural elements defining the landscape around him. Each piece is the result of a meditative process combining spatial qualities, shapes, and species of the surrounding environment. He expresses his style through various means. His use of drawing, painting, printing techniques, installations, and audio-video production confirms his aim to create and experiment with different art forms.</p>\n<p>He participated in many international events. Among the most remarkable there are the La Tour Paris Project, 2013, considered one of the most innovative contemporary art projects worldwide, and Artmossphere, the first Street Art Biennale held in Moscow in 2014, featuring 70 artists from all over the world.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>The Fatale series is a collection of female portraits that allow me to explore a more &#39;complete&#39; portrait in comparison to some of my more abstract/expressionist works. Fatale normally refers to a woman who lures men into dangerous situations with her beauty &amp; seductiveness. I like the idea that the name of the series gives the female portraits some power and an underlying mystery. I hope these paintings lure people in to imagine and discover their own interpretation of the story behind each portrait.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Very Little Helps first appeared as a mural street art work by Banksy that he created on the side of a pharmacy on Essex Road in North London. Released in 2008 as an edition of 299, the print shows three children standing around a flagpole. One of the children is raising not a flag but a Tesco plastic bag whilst the other two watch on and pledge allegiance by placing their hands across their hearts.</p>\n<p>The blue, calming background of the piece is punctuated with the absurdist scene as Banksy calls into question both the commodification and corporatisation of modern Britain. The title of the piece itself is a reference to Tesco’s (the biggest supermarket in the UK at the time) slogan “Every Little Helps”. Does every little help? It appears not. Banksy, in his typical irreverent style, pokes fun and mocks the giant corporation and, whilst it could be found across the country, the print makes the viewer wonder what the price we must pay is. Yes, there is a certain ease in terms of our shopping, but we have become a monolithic nation at the behest of corporations and have lost our identity in the process</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>First appearing stencilled onto the side of a house in Bristol (long thought to be the hometown of the secretive artist) ‘Barcode’ has become one of the most sought after of all Banksy artworks.</p>\n<p>Much like in many of his early prints, the artist uses a monochrome to further emphasise the subject. In Barcode, a leopard emerges onto the foreground of the sheet appearing to break free from the confines of a cage on wheels that resembles a barcode, its bars bent by the powerful creature. Menacingly emerging towards the viewer, the organic matter of the leopard is juxtaposed with the digital, ethereal world of barcodes (like Neo escaping the Matrix) as nature fights from man’s attempt to contain it. Or are we the leopard in the work?</p>\n<p>Captured and shackled by our digital world as we strive to break free? There is beauty and danger here, confronting the viewer directly as we fall in its line of sight of the exotic beast. Banksy at his best with a flourish and a twist wrapped up in a seemingly simple image.</p>\n",

Berta mixes minimalism with underlying texture and embraces modernism while compiling the odds and ends of her attempts to let her art speak for itself.</p>\n<p>Her abstract works often include reminders of her travels expressed in unexpected sequences of patterns as well as distortion of perspectives and subconscious spaces. Manipulating the texture with several layers of texture paste and acrylic paint, she will work and re-work her canvases, layering textures to give added dimension, and creating works that intrigue and invite the viewer to explore not only the surface but also the inner language of the painting.</p>\n<p>A passionate, award-winning artist of Hungarian heritage, Clara Berta&#39;s dynamic and highly textural abstract works have been exhibited and collected worldwide.</p>\n<p>SELECT EXHIBITIONS<br>2020 Artspace Warehouse, Los Angeles, CA<br>2019 Bistango Restaurant with Ethos Contemporary, Irvine, CA<br>2019 MAC Fine Art, Ft.

It comes from the collection of revered writer and curator Ursula Hoff, and is inscribed with a dedication to her on its verso. </p>\n<p>For collectors of Boyd and those interested in provenance, ‘The Prodigal [Son]’ is a majestic find. </p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>“Golden Sky Glow” is an original oil painting from my abstract landscape collection. This collection draws inspiration from the natural world ~ the contours of the land and hills, the sky’s atmosphere and cloud formations, the flow of the sea and rivers. These shapes and forms are abstracted to their energetic essence and combined with the vibrant colors that I love so much. Each unique painting has a modern minimal aesthetic in a wide array of energetic color palettes to add some fresh energy and vitality to any space. The sky glows a warm orange and yellow as the sun illuminates the clouds while setting in a vibrant blue sky. There is a suggestion of distant hills above the land glowing in warm earthy colors. The vibrant colors are warm and inviting, to add some positive energy and vitality to any space. Painted on a 1.5” gallery wrapped canvas with the edges painted white and finished with a coat of protective varnish, it comes ready to hang and signed on the front. Thank you for your interest in my work.

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Not Framed </p>\n<p>Courtesy of the artist and Canada, New York</p>\n<p>New York-based Katherine Bradford (b.1942) paints luminous fields of color filled with people in action or in repose–often swimming, flying, or floating. Bradford paints with a formal inventiveness and a shifting sense of figure and ground, giving narrative weight to her characters who may appear as heroes or lovers, families or couples,<br>businessmen or isolated individuals. Her chromatic scenes, painted in many transparent layers of acrylic, transmit a light-filled quality, and offer metaphorical possibilities as they veer between humor, pathos and abstraction. Bradford is represented by Canada and has exhibited widely at institutions such as: MoMA P.S. 1 and the Brooklyn Museum, NY. Her work is included in collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Menil Collection, the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, the Portland Museum of Art, among others. Recent museum exhibitions include a survey show at the Portland Museum of Art, Portland Maine which traveled to the Frye Museum in Seattle Washington. Bradford was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2011 and a Joan Mitchell Grant in 2012. Bradford lives and works in New York City and Brunswick, Maine.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>STARSKY BRINE’s paintings and drawings captivate audiences with their distinctive style and a recurring theme, the search for the nature of humanity. In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p>\n<p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p>\n<p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p>\n<p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>“Dynamic Sky” is an original oil painting from my abstract landscape collection. This collection draws inspiration from the natural world ~ the contours of the land and hills, the sky’s atmosphere and cloud formations, the flow of the sea and rivers. These shapes and forms are abstracted to their energetic essence and combined with the vibrant colors that I love so much. Each unique painting has a modern minimal aesthetic in a wide array of energetic color palettes to add some fresh energy and vitality to any space. The sky glows in rich shades of orange and pink as the sun illuminates the clouds while setting in a vivid blue sky. There is a suggestion of distant hills above a body of water that lights up with a blue and orange glow. The vibrant colors create dynamic contrast giving both an energetic feeling combined with the calm tranquility of the water reflections. Painted on a 1.5” gallery wrapped canvas with the edges painted white and finished with a coat of protective varnish, it comes ready to hang and signed on the front. Thank you for your interest in my work.

    "additionalInformation": "<p>STARSKY BRINE’s paintings and drawings captivate audiences with their distinctive style and a recurring theme, the search for the nature of humanity. In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p>\n<p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p>\n<p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p>\n<p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Along with Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, Tom Wesselmann is considered a major figure of New York Pop art. He rejected the principles of Abstract Expressionism and made bold paintings and inventive sculptures—both cut-metal works and assemblages—which riff on pop culture and art historical compositions. Women were a constant source of inspiration: Wesselmann’s most famous series, “Great American Nude” (1961–73), channels the brazen energy of American advertising and features flat, faceless female figures whom the artist often situated among stars and stripes. Educated at Cooper Union and the Art Academy of Cincinnati, Wesselmann got his start selling cartoons to magazines, newspapers, and ad agencies before he found success as a fine artist. Today, he’s represented in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, among other institutions. At auction, his work frequently sells for seven figures.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Imani Bilal is a contemporary abstract painter and poet based in Jersey City, New Jersey. Her work is deeply inspired by the many states of the human condition and is rooted in her spiritual (Islamic) practices. As she explains, “I strive to convey the notion of Tawheed (oneness), the idea of primordial matter, chaos, and calm; of all things sharing a source and being connected to an infinite mound, inclusive of the human experience.”<br>Her language is versatile and her approach, unconventional, working with acrylic, ink, and resin to articulate emotion and promote connectivity through color and movement. Bilal, who has been experimenting with paint since childhood, has developed a unique process of her own. She often paints while seated on the floor to pour her whole body into the composition, using her hands, mouth, and found objects to create an array of effects that become part of an intricate yet fluid work of art.<br>Bilal’s first solo show in New York City, Fingerprints of Ruh (2020), curated by Nemo Librizzi, was met with enthusiasm and led to gallery representation by Chase Contemporary Gallery and recently, Mazlish Gallery.<br>Dubbed “a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary art world” by Forbes Magazine, her work has captivated many. Bilal says abstraction is rebellious by nature and fuels her artistic freedom. She is among a small community of Black Muslim American women who push the avant-garde.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>“Dynamic Sunset” is an original oil painting from my abstract landscape collection. This collection draws inspiration from the natural world ~ the contours of the land and hills, the sky’s atmosphere and cloud formations, the flow of the sea and rivers. These shapes and forms are abstracted to their energetic essence and combined with the vibrant colors that I love so much. Each unique painting has a modern minimal aesthetic in a wide array of energetic color palettes to add some fresh energy and vitality to any space. The sky glows in rich deep shades of yellow, orange, pink and purple as the sun illuminates the clouds while setting in the sky. There is a suggestion of distant hills above a field of deep green and reddish brown in the foreground. The warm and vibrant colors create dynamic contrast and an energetic pop of color to brighten any space. This painting is a Diptych - Two gallery wrapped canvases 24”H x 18”W x 1.5” - Total size 24”H x 36”W Painted on a 1.5” gallery wrapped canvas with the edges painted white and finished with a coat of protective varnish, it comes ready to hang and signed on the front.

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Martha Washington, Polly Cooper and the<br>Black Shawl is a painting about the legend<br>surrounding the black shawl given to<br>Oneida Native American, Polly Cooper, after<br>the Valley Forge winter of 1778 during the<br>American Revolution. In gratitude for her<br>critical help during the dire winter, Cooper,<br>who refused monetary compensation, was<br>gifted a black shawl. According to verbal<br>accounts by descendants, she saw the<br>shawl in a shop window in Philadelphia<br>and the wives of the officers acquired<br>funds from Congress to procure the shawl.<br>Another story maintains Martha Washington<br>purchased the shawl for her. The shawl,<br>which is in near perfect condition and<br>a treasured relic to the Oneida people,<br>symbolizes a covenant of friendship and<br>sacrifice linking the Americans and the<br>Oneidas.<br>The Legend of the Hermit Thrush is an<br>Oneida cautionary tale. According to the<br>story, birds envied the human song and the<br>Creator in response instructed them to fly at<br>sunrise as high as they could. The bird who<br>flew the highest would receive the most<br>beautiful song. The brown thrush, fearing<br>his size would be a disadvantage, hid in<br>the eagle’s feathers. The last bird flying was<br>the eagle, with the thrush still hidden. The<br>thrush started his upward flight as the eagle<br>tired and learned his song. Upon return, the<br>thrush was ashamed and hid in the woods.<br>The thrush’s song is considered a song that<br>shines upon the hearts of those entering<br>the forest. In my painting, the thrush has<br>a thread of the shawl, perhaps to give the<br>shawl it’s song.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Los Angeles artist Amber Goldhammer paints dramatic abstract compositions in acrylic on canvas featuring energetic brushstrokes. Goldhammer uses her contemporary paintings to express emotions akin to silent poetry while drawing inspiration for her palette from the layered world around her. Her artworks include layered textures and playful details along the surfaces.</p>\n<p>This original graffiti-inspired painting measures 30-inches high by 40-inches wide. The sides are painted grey and it does not require framing. It is wired and ready to hang. This painting is signed and titled by the artist on the back. Free local Los Angeles area delivery. Affordable Continental U.S. and global shipping available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Amber Goldhammer is best known for creating vibrant abstract paintings with a street art edge. She originally started painting with pigments, powders, and waxes and went on to experiment with different mediums and processes to keep evolving her artworks. As love and joy are paramount emotions in life, Goldhammer hopes her series incorporating the “I Love You” message expands to reach a wide audience. Connecting people through public art is one way she believes her street murals can impact lives, as it is impossible to view her work and not feel a sense of joy and love.</p>\n<p>Painting a convergence of color and emotion, she builds and layers bold colors organically, allowing the process to determine the outcome. There is no analyzing, conceptualizing, or judging that takes place. It all happens in the moment, as a union between her, the canvas, and the paint. Amber Goldhammer frequently draws inspiration for her palette from the colors of the ocean, saying, “I get to take in the essence of the ocean every day, which fuels my creativity and brings me peace.”</p>\n<p>A worldwide collected young artist with ongoing concurrent exhibitions in galleries throughout the United States and Switzerland, Goldhammer&#39;s artworks have also been exhibited at major international art fairs. Her original paintings have been showcased in print and online publications, and on such TV series as “Million Dollar Listing,” “Being Mary Jane,” “The Catch” as well as both multi-Emmy® nominated series, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”, and “Scandal.” Goldhammer’s art is also featured on Netflix’s original series, “G.L.O.W.” by “Weeds” creator, Jenji Kohan.</p>\n<p>Artspace Warehouse has been representing and exhibiting Amber Goldhammer&#39;s original artworks since 2011. The gallery has been a 1stdibs partner since 2014 with consistently excellent reviews from clients worldwide. The gallery exhibits a large selection of affordable original artworks from established and emerging international artists with diverse backgrounds at high standards.

First appearing in 2003, Love is in the Air or Flower Thrower as it is also known, was a large stencilled piece of graffiti that appeared following the building of the West Bank Wall which stretches some 750km and separates Palestine from Israel.</p>\n<p>As with many of the artist’s works the image has also been repurposed and given a new context in the rare CCCP Flower Thrower. Believed to be from an edition of approximately only 10, this rare work seldom appears on the open market or at auction, the iconic flower thrower - in this instance - is clad in black against the red Soviet lettering: CCCP is the acronym for Союз Советских Социалистических Республик in Russian.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>In this beautiful pastel from the Nabis period, Roussel depicts a highly characteristic image of his family at leisure in the French countryside. Despite the heavily decorative, almost abstract use of flat colour, the artist picks out the accoutrements of contemporary Parisian fashions in the ladies’ large colourful hats, creating a scene that falls between the bucolic and the modern.</p>\n<p>Roussel studied at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris in the 1880s where he met his lifelong friend, artistic partner and future brother-in-law, Edouard Vuillard. Roussel went on to study at the Académie Julian in Paris where he met Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard and Paul Sérusier, and along with Vuillard became part of the artistic group which became known as ‘Les Nabis’ or Prophets. The group were highly influenced by Gauguin and sought to push art beyond the objectivity of Impressionism, to create to imagery that looked beyond visual reality to create a synthesis of colour, form and spiritual feeling. </p>\n<p>The Nabis were particularly inspired by Japanese woodcuts and its use of flat, bold areas of colours, which can be seen in &#39;Le Pique-nique des Roussel à L’Etang-la-Ville&#39;. In this work Roussel also uses the colour and texture of the bare paper as an active ingredient in the work, which gives the artwork a sense of lightness and freedom of design, as well as a rejection of traditional artistic illusionism. Famously Denis announced ‘remember that a picture, before being a battle horse, a female nude or some sort of anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain order’ in his original Nabis manifesto and we see these ideals presented in the present work by Roussel.</p>\n<p>Roussel’s work originally sold by legendary galleries such as Galerie Vollard and Galerie Bernheim-Jeune and his pastoral scenes are currently the subject of an exhibition at the Musée des Impressionnismes Giverny ‘Ker-Xavier Roussel. Private Garden, Dreamed Garden.’ The artist has also had a major international exhibitions at the Musée de l’Orangerie, Paris, The Institute of Arts, Minneapolis and the Haus der Kunst, Munich amongst others and his works are held in public collections across France. </p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Inspired by the &#39;Tippoo&#39;s Tiger&#39; sculpture collection from the Victoria and Albert Museum. Tipu Tiger was created for Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore in South India from 1782 to 1799. A tiger, an almost life-sized wooden semi-automatic, mauls a European soldier lying on his back. Hidden inside the tiger&#39;s body, behind a flap, is an organ that can be controlled by turning the knob next to it. This simultaneously causes the man&#39;s hand to rise and fall and produces sounds that mimic his death moans. “In my work Still Waters Run Deep, the heroine seated on a tiger, who devours a lying man, exults and triumphs over aggression and masculinity. It is surrounded by sensitive elements and an additional blue male head, bringing emphasis to the whole &quot;marzipan-sweet&quot; composition.”</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Kathleen Keifer&#39;s original artworks represent one of the most significant expressions of New California Realism. Keifer brings a fresh perspective to her colorful scenes of everyday life in the sun along the Pacific coastline (and beyond). Her detailed paintings show us the breathtaking California scenery with its recognizable elements in a new light and with a keen eye for clever composition and layered colors. Her modern landscapes and sublime seascapes capture an impressive visceral visual.</p>\n<p>This one-of-a-kind 30-inch high by 15-inch wide and 1.5-inch deep original artwork is a composition created with acrylic paint on canvas. It is stretched, wired, and ready to hang. The sides are painted as a continuation of the front and it does not require framing. It is signed by the artist on the front of the artwork. A certificate of authenticity issued by the gallery is included. Convenient local Los Angeles area shipping. Affordable Continental U.S. and global shipping also available. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Kathleen Keifer is a California-based internationally collected artist. Her paintings invite the viewer to consider the complex relationship between time and timelessness. It is the sheer visual interaction between the elements, taken in their bare simplicity that interests her. Water, sky, and architecture change their appearance with the shifts in weather and light. Her broken brushstrokes depict light and color in luminous waves, dissolving form into a shimmering surface of vibrant light. For her, painting captures the very essence of time and its passage.</p>\n<p>While painting landscapes she became fascinated with isolating the objects in her paintings. She believes that actual sites and places have individual magic. The goal is to take objects from popular culture and paint them in a new context. She began to paint the silhouette of the Life Guard Tower more as a pop art symbol than a landscape element. With a high level of technical virtuosity, Keifer creates a new sense of reality with textures and colors that seem to add lighting effects and distinct shadows, confronting the viewer with new interpretations of familiar objects.</p>\n<p>Born and raised in Chicago, Kathleen Keifer is a second-generation artist. Her mother, also a fine artist, exposed Keifer to the world of art and supervised her training from a very early age.

    "additionalInformation": "<p>STARSKY BRINE’s paintings and drawings captivate audiences with their distinctive style and a recurring theme, the search for the nature of humanity. In his bold works, the artist focuses on characters that are built from a combination of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features, as well as the appropriation of elements from comics and toys from his childhood.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, these characters distort reality to venture into an environment of subcultures and urbanism created by the spontaneous intuition of his strokes and the appropriation of the contemporary iconography. On the other hand, they move within the realm of fantasy. In particular, the animals paired with their human characters evoke associations with fairy tales or comics. They are reminiscent of the world of theatre, in which fantasy and poetry but also comedy often serve as catalysts for the creation of critical meaning.</p>\n<p>With his works, Brines often questions the interplay of good and evil against the background of the worldwide socio-political climate. Yet Brines does not interpret his themes as ‘black and white.’ They are complex and nonlinear, with charming disruptions, quite serious and yet full of humor.</p>\n<p>Brines is personally influenced by his mother and art historically influenced by Latin American figurative art, the German Neoexpressionism, the Italian Transavantgarde, and the COBRA group. His works oscillate between figuration and abstraction. Brines holds a degree in Fine Art from the Instituto Universitario de Estudios Superiores de Artes Plásticas Armando Reverón in Caracas.</p>\n<p>His work has received international attention in exhibitions and has been incorporated into important collections in cities such as Caracas, Basel, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Santander, Miami, Madrid and Seoul.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Born in Harbin, China, 1957. Lives and works in Beijing</p>\n<p>Classified in China under the genre Political Pop of the Chinese Contemporary Art Movement, Wang Guangyi’s paintings combine the ideological power of communist propaganda with the seductive allure of advertising. Wang’s paintings appropriated the visual tropes of the propaganda of the Cultural Revolution with the colour style of American Pop. Juxtaposing revolutionary images with consumer logos, Wang’s canvases provocate with their duplicitous message, highlighting the conflict between China’s political past and commercialised present. Stylistically merging the government enforced aesthetic of agitprop with the kitsch sensibility of American pop, Wang’s work adopts the cold-war language of the 60s to ironically examine the contemporary polemics of globalisation.</p>\n<p>Wang Guangyi definitive painting series “Great Criticism, was motivated by his perceptive understanding of commercial society. His paintings expressed that imported commodities from the West had entered China in large quantities in the 90s and to the artist it seemed that this was an invasion of culture , Western ideology and consumerism that have infiltrate into China. Through his critique, Wang’s paintings weave intricate narratives, implicating the role of the artist as an active participant (both as subjugator and subservient) in economic and social policy. Wang treads a very delicate line between moral dictum and capitalist endorsement; the interpretation of his paintings alternates with the subjectivity of context. Amalgamating, confusing, and blurring opposing ideological beliefs, Wang’s billboard sized canvases readily sell out national valour, while simultaneously devaluing status symbol luxury for the proletariat cause.</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Kathleen Keifer is a California-based internationally collected artist. She is a leading force of the New California Realism. With a high level of technical virtuosity Keifer creates a new sense of reality with textures and colors that seem to add lighting effects and distinct shadows, confronting the viewer with new interpretations of familiar objects.</p>\n<p>This one-of-a-kind 12 inch square and 1.5-inch deep original artwork is a composition created with acrylic paint on canvas. It is wired and ready to hang. The sides are painted as a continuation of the front and it does not require framing. It signed by the artist on the front of the artwork. Convenient local Los Angeles area shipping. Affordable Continental U.S. and global shipping also available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Kathleen’s paintings invite the viewer to consider the complex relationship between time and timelessness. It is the sheer visual interaction between the elements, taken in their bare simplicity that interests her. For her, painting captures the very essence of time and its passage. She believes that actual sites and places have an individual magic. The goal is to take objects from popular culture and paint them in a new narrative context. Her complex approaches to popular board games present the subjects as living, tangible objects.</p>\n<p>Born and raised in Chicago, Kathleen Keifer is a second-generation artist. Her mother, also a fine artist, exposed Keifer to the world of art and supervised her training from a very early age. This legacy continues today as Keifer closely nurtures the development of the artistic leaning in each of her three daughters, inspiring a third generation of female artists. Her works are represented by Artspace Warehouse Los Angeles and have been exhibited and collected internationally, including Chicago, New York and London.</p>\n<p>Education and Honors<br>B.F.A.

    "additionalInformation": "<p>Coulombe-Bégin&#39;s dynamic acrylic on canvas works seek to produce a metamorphic interpretation of the artist&#39;s inner identity. Her paintings make ample use of contrasting colors to create exuberance and energy in her images. Inspired by street art, Coulombe Bégin &#39;s paintings range from the abstract to the surreal and employ a variety of techniques and materials. Her contemporary artworks draw inspiration from body image, the universally recognizable symbol of hearts, and the experience of humankind. She brings a sensitivity to her work that stems from her exploration of identity and the joy and happiness of existence. Coulombe-Bégin draws us into her internal world: exploring the soul and matter, conscience, and the modern universe.</p>\n<p>This original painting depicting one colorful heart painted on a silver background measures 12 inches square. This thickly textured heart is applied with tactile brushwork. It is wired and ready to hang. The sides of this artwork are painted black and it does not require framing. Convenient local Los Angeles area shipping. Affordable Continental U.S. and worldwide shipping also available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the art gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artspace Warehouse, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Coulombe-Bégin’s work portrays from colorful hearts to specific parts of the human body, especially large close-up portrayals of the mouth and eyes, which are depicted with great contrasts of color and chiaroscuro. These symbols are constructed with specific gestures and drippings in which Coulombe-Bégin expresses an abstract universe full of movement, symbolism, and eroticism.</p>\n<p>Born in Miami, Coulombe-Bégin grew up in Quebec City where she earned a Bachelor of Visual Arts in 2006 from Laval University. Starting very young, her parents focused a great deal on both the arts and athletics which helped her develop her own mode of expression.<br>“I am particularly interested in the fragmented corporal shell, which I emphasize through spontaneous movement and vivid colors.” stated Coulombe-Bégin. “My experience with painting has led me to see things differently, to self-discovery and to great astonishment.&quot;</p>\n<p>Coulombe-Bégin&#39;s works have been exhibited and collected worldwide, including Canada, the United States, Europe, South America, and Australia.</p>\n<p>Provenance: Artspace Warehouse</p>\n",

    "additionalInformation": "<p>“Glowing Evening” is an original oil painting from my abstract landscape collection. This collection draws inspiration from the natural world ~ the contours of the land and hills, the sky’s atmosphere and cloud formations, the flow of the sea and rivers. These shapes and forms are abstracted to their energetic essence and combined with the vibrant colors that I love so much. Each unique painting has a modern minimal aesthetic in a wide array of energetic color palettes to add some fresh energy and vitality to any space. The sky glows in soft shades of orange, pink and purple as the sun illuminates the clouds while setting in the sky. A thin strip of water is lit up with a reddish glow being framed by distant hills and the shoreline above a rich brown foreground. It captures the magical feeling of twilight, where the light softens and warms at the end of the day. The rich warm colors create a calm and soothing feeling combined with the peaceful tranquility of the water reflections. This painting is a Diptych - Two gallery wrapped canvases 24”H x 18”W x 1.5” - Total size 24”H x 36”W Painted on a 1.5” gallery wrapped canvas with the edges painted white and finished with a coat of protective varnish, it comes ready to hang and signed on the front. Thank you for your interest in my work.

He paints what he feels. It is not his purpose to hurt or to surprise. He refuses to be an artist giving an esoteric message. Genuine and unaffected, his work is only intended to people with a touch of poesy and imagination waiting to bloom inside them.<br>Through finesse and powerful work, rich colors and masterly technique, his artwork is extremely creative. The atmosphere that François d&#39;Izarny creates in his paintings leads us to a world filled with emotions. His works portray sensitivity, sincerity, and elegance.<br>His work does not accommodate with technical considerations or academic references. He believes that academic teaching dims the light of nature and coals the warmth of life. The magic comes from the subtleties of his brushstrokes, the harmony of colors and from a vibrating exquisite and indefinable light.</p>\n",

Partially restraining the seemingly boundless color are bold gestures Pinto Schmid creates with swift confidence. Each painting is meant to communicate a multitude of feelings and styles which can be reorganized infinitely within one&#39;s imagination.</p>\n<p>This large one-of-a-kind colorful mixed media painting on canvas measures 48 inches high by 76 inches wide. It is stretched, wired, and ready to hang. It is signed by Pinto on the front and back. Free local Los Angeles area delivery. Affordable Continental U.S. and International shipping available. A certificate of authenticity issued by the gallery is included. This artwork is exhibited at Artplex Gallery, one of the leading international art galleries in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Born in Tuscany and raised between Germany and Italy, Pinto Schmid is influenced by particularly German cubism as well as his father’s art practice. Growing up with an ever-present home studio helped push his art practice as he matured. His artworks have been collected and exhibited internationally gracing a number of prominent homes.</p>\n<p>REPRESENTATION<br>Artplex Gallery, Los Angeles</p>\n",
